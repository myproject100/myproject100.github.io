    <p><b>C Sharp Video Productions</b> generate leads and build revenue for local businesses through video production and storytelling. During their growth stage, the CEO reached out to us for assistance in their marketing strategy. So we were honored when we began working with them. </p>

    <p>Our work with C Sharp spans multiple projects—the organization already had begun enhancing their strong brand when they were introduced to us. 
</p>
    <p>One of our first projects was to create networking strategy to increase presence within their local Chamber of Commerce mixer events. So prior to each event, we worked closely with the CEO to design a “meet and greet” strategy followed by a drip email campaign to stay in touch with new connections.

</p>
    <p>On days when we’re networking, we help track and analyze data as well as engineered a lead generation system that they can use to mine for potential leads on the web. 

The C Sharp brand is effortlessly infused with our marketing approach, we made sure it continues to stay align with their mission.

In addition to supporting the thought leadership for their brand, we also write for their newsletter from time to time.
