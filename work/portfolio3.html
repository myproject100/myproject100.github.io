    <p><b>EcoTourLinQ </b> is an online community for people like you who are concerned with environmental conservation and responsible travel. Every now and then, they like put together free give-aways and would inquire our help in designing their digital ads.  </p>

    <p>Having worked with them previously, we had a system that we both followed to streamlined our designing process. They send over a pencil sketch mock up of what they imagine the final design to look like and we would put together a few fidelity mock up. Then, we would go through a few revision process until they are happy with he final look.
