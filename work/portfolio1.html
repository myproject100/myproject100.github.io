    <p><b>DeepDyve</b> brings true change to scholarly and professional research with its affordable rentals and free full-text previews. When they decided it was time for them to market to corporate customers, they contacted us — thus, sparking a beginning of the account management program.</p>
    <p>Over a period of 3 years, we’ve helped them implement and fine-tune the company’s corporate program from the ground up. This included copywriting email campaigns, sales scripts, producing explainer videos. From there, we’ve designed a succinct on-boarding process and engagement email lifecycle to help the company stay engaged with their customers.
</p>
    <p>The company also required an informative marketing collateral for the sales team, which was a great opportunity to redesign their print materials. 
</p>
    <p>Working with DeepDyve’s corporate program was enjoyable but managing its marketing and creative projects has proven to be even more fun. The company is thriving, and with the success of the corporate program growing too, they’ve decided to keep us on contract to consultant from time to time.
